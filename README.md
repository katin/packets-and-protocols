# packets-and-protocols

A resource pack for infosec professionals and students focusing on the capture, analysis, pentesting, and securing of network traffic and network appliances. This is a package of markdown documents that will map out resources relevant to the topic. Eventually, I hope to also have a document that describes one more learning paths through the resources.

## Standard Learning Recommendations
Infosec / cybersecurity is a fast-growing and vast field. The depths of knowledge required to be effective and professional are challenging to develop and master. These top four pro-tips are important to follow in order to support your health, comprehension, and effective learning. 

1. Use the pattern of: (1) learn, (2) practice at a level of intensity that just pushes you past your point of comfort / competence, and then (3) sleep. (Not watching video, reading, driving, etc., but sleep.)

3. Avoid the antipattern of: skimming material as quickly as possible to solve one CTF, one problem, and driving yourself to surf and run through the processes (whatever you are working on) as quickly as you can. This is a failure pattern. Getting into this habit will also maximize your burnout risks later on. The pressure to go fast as you can is extraordinarily high in the domain of infosec, but it means that what you skimmed / solved in this manner is (a) not retained for future access, and (b) not connected to the bigger and deeper picture of the hows-and-why it worked (or didn't work). When going deep, go slow so that everything soaks in and connects meta-wise at both low levels and 30,000-ft levels. This is critical to moving forward in your career in infosec.

4. Build the habit and tolerance for being a beginner, over and over again. Every new domain of infosec your touch has hundreds of tools, command flags, tricks, and specialized knowledge. You will constantly feel like you don't know enough. Mastering being a good beginner and knowing how to effectively learn in a new domain is the secret to success in infosec.

5. Develop and use whatever learning tools work best for you. Note apps, index cards, databases, sketchbooks, whatever. There is a huge amount of information to track, tag, and organize as you learn. Get good at this. Put some effort into selecting methods that are reliable and accessible, and spend the time needed to learn them well.
